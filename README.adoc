= ID4i CLI

ID4i Command Line Interface

You can use this application to ...

* ... perform manual tasks in ID4i
* ... include ID4i tasks in arbitrary shell scripts
* ... query ID4i manually or as part of existing workflows.

CAUTION: ID4i CLI is currently a work in progress and should not be used in production; at least not
without getting in touch first. More operations _will_ be added in the future.

ID4i CLI is configurable using environment variables, a variety of configuration files
and command line switches. See the <<Usage>> section or `id4i help` for details.

Since we do not have extensive experience in `golang`, we are thankful for contributions and/or bitching and nagging,
especially in combination with pointers to more idiomatic alternative implementations.

== Usage

=== Prerequisites

For the CLI to be able to communicate with ID4i, you need an ID4i API key.

Complete the following steps to get from zero to your first successful ID4i CLI operation:

. If you have not already done, register a user on ID4i. Use https://sandbox.id4i.de/#/register for care-free experimenting,
and https://backend.id4i.de/#/register for production use.
. Create and activate an API key (the development manual at https://backend.id4i.de/docs/reference/en/reference.html#_preparation has more info and screenshots)
.. Navigate to `API Keys -> New API Key`
.. Note your API key secret and your API key ID
.. Activate the API key
. Figure out your organization's namespace (or even better, create a new one) on `Organizations`
. Configure the CLI to use your API key
.. EITHER set `ID4I_APIKEY`, `ID4I_SECRET`, `ID4I_BACKEND` and `ID4I_ORGANZATION` environment variables
.. OR use a configuration file in the current or your home directory named `.id4i.properties` (or `.json` or `.yml`)
and set the properties `apikey`, `secret`, `backend` and `organization` there
.. OR use command line flags for these parameters as described in <<Help>>
.. OR any combination of the above. You get the point.
. Give your API key the corresponding permissions required to carry out the task you want.
Go to the details page of your API key and set the permissions. You can learn about what happens in the
background here: https://sandbox.id4i.de/docs/reference/en/reference.html#_create_guids_code_2_code_and_learn_about_things_that_can_go_wrong

You can either get a binary for your platform or run the ID4i CLI within Docker: `docker run bluerainsoftware/id4i <args>`. e.g.
`docker run bluerainsoftware/id4i help` or `docker run bluerainsoftware/id4i info -h`.

For details on how to configure the image with your API key and other required properties, see https://hub.docker.com/r/bluerainsoftware/id4i-cli/

=== Help

ID4i API commandline application.

Configuration:
  You can set global parameters in different locations (ordered by precedence):
  - As command line parameter, e.g. --apikey or -k
  - Using environment variable under the "ID4I_" prefix, e.g. "ID4I_APIKEY"
  - In a configuration file. 
    Default locations are ./.idi.<type> and ~/.id4i.<type> with <type> denoting the file format (json, yml, toml, hcl, properties)

(statically generated using `update-readme.sh`)

== Development

If you need additional commands, feel free to jump in or let us know.

If you want to get involved, https://github.com/BlueRainSoftware/id4i-cli/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22 has good issues to get you started.

=== Prerequisites

* Go 1.11.2
* Go Dep, get it w/ `go get -u -v github.com/golang/dep/cmd/dep`
* Docker, if you want to build the docker image. `v18.06.1-ce` and `v17.03.0-ce` are known to work
* If you want to scaffold new commands, the `cobra` generator will help you: `go get github.com/spf13/cobra/cobra

=== Build

* `git clone git@github.com:BlueRainSoftware/id4i-cli.git $GOPATH/src/github.com/BlueRainSoftware/id4i-cli`
* `cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/BlueRainSoftware/id4i-cli`
* `dep ensure -v`
* `go build -o id4i main.go`
* Update the `README` with the current help contents: `./update-readme.sh`

=== Adding new commands

We use the awesome `cobra` footnote:[https://github.com/spf13/cobra] and `viper` footnote:[https://github.com/spf13/viper] libraries.

To scaffold a new command, clone the repo and say `cobra add <my command> -p rootCmd`.

Open the generated command and implement your operation:

* Define your parameters in `init`.
* Validate your input, if required.
* Use the operations exposed in `ID4i` (from `rootCmd`) to call the backend.
* Use the `OutputResult` and `DieOnError` functions from `rootCmd` to report the result of your command.
* Add your command to `./update-readme.sh` so the `README` gets updated with the new command

You can find examples for each step in the existing commands.

If you want to debug the calls you are making, set the `DEBUG` environment variable to a non-empty value.
This will cause the HTTP calls to be logged to the console.

==== Updating the API version

The API client is generated using `go-swagger` footnote:[https://github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger, https://goswagger.io/].

To update the client for the CLI, run `./generate-api-client.sh -c -d` from the project root. Note that `-d` installs `go-swagger`
locally and `-c` pulls the current API specification from ID4i production footnote:[https://backend.id4i.de/docs/swagger.json; use the corresponding URL for other environments, e.g. https://sandbox.id4i.de/docs/swagger.json]

Run the tests and make required corrections in the existing commands if applicable. The ID4i change logs footnote:[https://github.com/BlueRainSoftware/support/tree/master/changelog]
are probably helpful.

==== Docker

To build the docker image, run `docker build . -t id4i:<my tag>`.

==== CI

CI Builds live at https://circleci.com/gh/BlueRainSoftware/workflows/id4i-cli, defined in `.circleci/config.yml`.
Note that currently, the build artifacts (binary and docker image) are not stored anywhere, so you probably
need to build it yourself. This will change, promise.

=== Run

After building, you can run the binary w/ `./id4i`.

=== Test

*TODO*

* Generate user w/ API key on develop (existing UI tests or curl)
* Have a shell script using the cli to carry out all operations
* Have the script run in CI
